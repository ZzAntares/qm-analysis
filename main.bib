@article{Kara2011,
abstract = {Prediction of stock price index movement is regarded as a challenging task of financial time series prediction. An accurate prediction of stock price movement may yield profits for investors. Due to the complexity of stock market data, development of efficient models for predicting is very difficult. This study attempted to develop two efficient models and compared their performances in predicting the direction of movement in the daily Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) National 100 Index. The models are based on two classification techniques, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM). Ten technical indicators were selected as inputs of the proposed models. Two comprehensive parameter setting experiments for both models were performed to improve their prediction performances. Experimental results showed that average performance of ANN model (75.74{\%}) was found significantly better than that of SVM model (71.52{\%}). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Pyo2017,
abstract = {The prediction of the trends of stocks and index prices is one of the important issues to market participants. Investors have set trading or fiscal strategies based on the trends, and considerable research in various academic fields has been studied to forecast financial markets. This study predicts the trends of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) prices using nonparametric machine learning models: artificial neural network, support vector machines with polynomial and radial basis function kernels. In addition, this study states controversial issues and tests hypotheses about the issues. Accordingly, our results are inconsistent with those of the precedent research, which are generally considered to have high prediction performance. Moreover, Google Trends proved that they are not effective factors in predicting the KOSPI 200 index prices in our frameworks. Furthermore, the ensemble methods did not improve the accuracy of the prediction.},
